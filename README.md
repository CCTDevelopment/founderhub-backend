I understand you're seeking a comprehensive review of the codebase at [https://github.com/CCTDevelopment/founderhub-backend](https://github.com/CCTDevelopment/founderhub-backend), including identifying and resolving any issues, as well as creating a detailed `README.md` file.

**Code Review and Issue Resolution:**

To effectively review and address issues within the codebase, consider the following steps:

1. **Static Code Analysis:** Utilize tools such as pylint or flake8 to analyze the code for syntax errors, code smells, and adherence to coding standards. These tools can automatically detect issues like unused variables, improper indentation, and potential bugs.

2. **Dependency Management:** Examine the `requirements.txt` file to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and necessary. Remove any unused dependencies and consider specifying version ranges to maintain compatibility.

3. **Security Audit:** Implement security scanning tools like Bandit to identify common security vulnerabilities within the Python codebase. Address any highlighted issues promptly.

4. **Testing:** Ensure that there is a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. Use frameworks like pytest to write and run tests, aiming for high code coverage to catch potential issues early.

5. **Documentation:** Review inline code comments and docstrings for clarity and completeness. Well-documented code facilitates easier maintenance and onboarding of new developers.

6. **Logging and Error Handling:** Assess the implementation of logging and error handling throughout the application. Ensure that errors are caught gracefully and informative logs are generated for debugging purposes.

7. **Performance Optimization:** Profile the application to identify any performance bottlenecks. Optimize database queries, algorithm efficiencies, and resource utilization as needed.

# FounderHub Backend

## Overview

The FounderHub Backend is a robust API service designed to power the FounderHub platform, facilitating seamless interactions between users and the system's core functionalities.

## Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user management with role-based access controls.
- **API Endpoints:** Comprehensive set of endpoints to support frontend interactions.
- **Database Integration:** Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a growing number of users and data volume.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the API.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for data persistence.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent deployment across environments.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CCTDevelopment/founderhub-backend.git
   cd founderhub-backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/founderhub
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

5. **Initialize the Database:**
   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Docker Deployment

To deploy the application using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t founderhub-backend .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env founderhub-backend
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                      |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/register`    | Register a new user              |
| POST   | `/api/login`       | Authenticate user and return token |
| GET    | `/api/profile`     | Retrieve user profile information |
| PUT    | `/api/profile`     | Update user profile information  |
| DELETE | `/api/profile`     | Delete user account              |
